  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned that drawing with a pen is really hard as although the arm has many parts such as wrist, elbow etc. It still doesn't have the fine skills that fingers do. Despite this I created a picture of a Blue Banana! XD</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think it was hard to work because there were too many chairs around my workspace which made me feel clustered, and as well as that it was really hot which meant I couldn't work to my full potential.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to clear my workspace of any unnecessary chairs.</td>
