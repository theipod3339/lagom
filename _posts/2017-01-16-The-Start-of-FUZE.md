(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, I played around with the basic system and how to print things, also creating a cool matrix style pattern. I was beginning to look at variables but I ran out of time. </td>

    <td>I learnt the basic functions of FUZE. I learnt how to setup the FUZE setup. I also learnt how to Print things. I printed this matrix running code thing where numbers just rolled across the screen like this: 1 4 6 7 3 5 8 9 6 7 8 3  2 5 6 8 7 7 6 5 5 7  8 9 9 8  6 5 4 3 2 1 2 2 3 4 5  6 7 8 8 9 9 8 7 6 6 7 8 7 7 7 8 77  64 564 8564 58 76 6 5 59 965 65 985 8 596 5 659 596 56 75 3 2 2 34 5 7 8 88 7  66 66 6 6 67  8 99 9 9 9y   0 0 0 99 9  8 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 34 565 456 7654 45678 7654 56788 7654 32 1234 67  6543</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think helping Felix added and hindered my learning. I suppose I learnt how to teach, but at the same time I slowed down my personal working. Also me and Felix both got distracted by Harvey and Joel who were always talking to us and showing us their new piece of code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try get less distracted by others, that way I will learn more. I will also try to read the instructions more before rushing off to do my own thing. </td>
