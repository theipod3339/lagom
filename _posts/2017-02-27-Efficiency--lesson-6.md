  <tr>
    <td>I started by putting in all the wires and leds into the fuze before coding, this meant we weren't be distracted by code, and felix could help more efficiently.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think we could have got a tiny bit more done at the end rather than celebrating what we had achieved.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to be even more efficient e.g. be quicker (but still careful) in everything I do; setting the FUZE up, coding, setting up hardware etc...</td>
