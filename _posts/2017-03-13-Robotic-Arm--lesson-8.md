    <td>Today we had one of the most beneficial lessons to my learning in a long time. I really felt like what we did today could actually give me an understanding into how life is in the robotic industry. To code the arm I had to really persevere because I found it very complicated but I eventually got it to work. I wanted to challenge maneuverability so I practised picking up a usb stick.</td>

    <td>I need to work on working in a good workspace. i.e taking my blazer off so I don't get too hot when I work.</td>

    <td>I will try to push myself and try to make things more complicated in coding but easier in understanding how it works and easier in using the code. i.e. Making it easier to use the robot arm.</td>
